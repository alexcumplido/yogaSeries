        Dear user, this is a work in progress. Expect limited functionality and
        unfriendly layout.
      </p>
      <p>However, you can still explore some yoga postures.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Some stuff I am working on:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Creating an API REST with Node.js, Express</li>
        <li>
          Enabling CRUD operations through mongoDB connection so users can store
          their series.
        </li>
        <li>A more intuitive a fluid layout.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
