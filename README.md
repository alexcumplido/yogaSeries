# Yoga Series

Yoga Series will support yoga practitioners in their postures. This is a work in progress.

[temploral deployment live here](https://yogaseries.vercel.app/)

Currently just finnished the API, so data will be provided. Have a look at [Yoga API](https://github.com/alexcumplido/yoga-api#yoga-api-%EF%B8%8F), an API returning yoga categories and postures in a JSON format.

Stuff I am working on:

- CRUD features
- User can create Serie
- User can delete Serie
  - User can create posture
  - User can read posture
  - User can update posture
  - User can delete posture
- User can save posture button fetch
- User can delete saved posture button fetch
